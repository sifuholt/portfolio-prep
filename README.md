### A Little Bit About Me

1. Seeker. Asker of questions.

2. I am coming into this at an interesting time in my life. I am a veteran of various branches of the military, originally from Oklahoma I not live in Oregon. I am married with two children and find myself continuing to be interested in evolving. One thing that is certain is that change will occur and one can either adapt and evolve and progress or, well... we are all stardust anyway. We are all here and what we have to say is important. In some way, either good or bad what we experience is exactly that. We observe and adjust accordingly. So I find myself sitting at this computer typing up something that I had no clue I would learn how to do, in hopes that at 47, I can find a way, not successfully or anything, just a way to become part of this world...if only for a little while.

3. While I am new to this field I bring a lifetime of experience in various other ways.

4. What excites me about this specifically is that it either works or doesn't. There are lots of ways around and that is evolution at its finest...learning each step to get to where some people just start from offers depth of understanding and intense clarity, even if you don't know it...grinding through the hours and just trying or hearing. Yea, this is where the human brain goes...
